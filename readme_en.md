Automatically integrate Orvibo switches into the open-source smart home system Home Assistant (only S20c and S30c have been tested so far).  

Installation Tutorial  

(1)Place the files in the custom_components directory, restart Home Assistant, and then you can add the integration in "Settings > Devices & Services".  

(2)Log in with your username and password to complete the setup.  

Usage Notes  
If you have other Orvibo switch models (excluding S20c and S30c), you can try adding their model names to the ORVIBO_SWITCH_MODEL list in const.py. Note that compatibility is not guaranteed.
